Pipeline for calibration, triangulation, and data processing using DeepLabCut and Anipose.


<details>
<summary>TO-DO</summary>

  + [x] Test the dlc and anipose pipeline
  + [x] Tuning for filtering parameters
  + [x] Calibration videos and files
  + [x] Figure out the axes and dimension
  + [x] Check other constraints
  + [ ] Documentation - docstrings
  + [ ] Documentation - steps, wiki about calibration etc.
  + [ ] Add loading of points as a sep fnc and fix the indices. (?)
  + [ ] Right now if a given directory already exists. Anipose does not run in that directory. Add a function to delete directories.
  + [ ] Change server names.
  + [ ] Implement the new approach with the animal calibration.
